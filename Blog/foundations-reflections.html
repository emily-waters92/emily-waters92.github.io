    <h2>Core learning review</h2>
    <p>
<u>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</u>
<br>

-	I have learnt that I am used to grasping concepts quickly and when I don’t, I get frustrated.<br>
-	I have learnt that I can be very critical of myself.<br>
-	I have learnt that get distracted easily.
<br>
<br>
<u>What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</u>
<br>
Being self-aware of your learning style is important so that you can use it to your advantage, as well as knowing your limitations. Having strong values and empathy is important for anyone who is working for a company and/or in a team/collaboration and are traits that are valued by most employers.
<br>
<br>
<u>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</u>
<br>
The fact that I have gone from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset in recent years without even knowing it! I loved the dive into neuroplasticity and the growth mindset and was surprised that even just knowing about neuroplasticity can help you change your brain make-up.
<br>
<br>
<u>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</u>
<br>
I didn’t find any of the core learning challenging, I really enjoyed it and found it very insightful.
<br>
<br>
<u>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</u>
<br>
I think that it is an important part of the curriculum as it will set us apart from the other candidates when applying for jobs. It’s all very well to be able to code but there is so much more that goes into employer-employee and co-worker relationships.
<br>
<br>
<u>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</u>
<br>
No. Not only did I really enjoy it, I think it plays a vital role in everyday life as well as helping with employability. I also think understanding about the growth mindset helps with the initial shock of pace that I’m sure most of us students went through when first starting Foundations.
<br>
<br>
<u>Have you noticed your strengths in practice?</u>
<br>
Yes, in particular perspective and humour. Perspective has been helpful when it comes to solving coding challenges and humour when I am noticing I am starting to get frustrated.
<br>
<br>
<u>Had any setbacks or challenges this week? What did you do to overcome these?
What will you do differently next time?
What was a highlight for you?</u>
<br>
Yes, I have found coding from (basically) scratch quite difficult and challenging. To overcome this, I broke it down into steps and used pseudocode as well as reaching out to my peers for help. Next time I will probably do the same as I find that pseudocode (whilst seemingly difficult at first) is quite helpful and my peers are a great strength to me to keep me upbeat and remind me that I can do this. A highlight would have been going into campus and meeting a few people from my cohort for the first time. Loved that.
