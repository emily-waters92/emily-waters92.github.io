    <p>
<strong><u>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</u></strong>
<br>
Neuroplasticity is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in the brain. By understanding the principles of it, we know that our brains neurological networks become stronger through practise and repetition and that our brains can be changed. This understanding helps one to realise that intelligence is malleable and therefore when presented with a difficult task, can give the person perseverance and empower them to keep trying and practising, as opposed to thinking they are incapable.
<br>
<br>
<strong><u>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</u></strong>
<br>
Practice, practice, practice! Also, allow myself to make mistakes and trust the process of learning. Whilst I might not learn something straight away, getting frustrated and shutting down is not going to help my brain grow and myself to get over the hurdle. Believing in my own capability and knowing that I can do this, it may just not be as quickly as I like it but that I will get there in the end through hard work and persistence.
<br>
<br>
<strong><u>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</u></strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Practising and repetition of something you may find difficult.</li>
<li>Finding relationships in new concepts ie. Working on projects that solve relevant problems in your life.</li>
<li>Reminding yourself that this is how the brain works and that some things take more persistence and hard work to stick than others.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<strong><u>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant to you?</u></strong>
<br>
A growth mindset is understanding that your talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence – not that you are born with fixed traits and that’s that. It is relevant to me because I know that going into this I am going to be challenged, and maybe even feel like I am dumb sometimes but that with persistence and effort I can develop my abilities and become whoever I want to be. I will get there!
<br>
<br>
<strong><u>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</u></strong>
<br>
I was surprised at how much my thinking has changed over these last few months. I have gone from having a mostly fixed mindset with where I am in my life and what I can do with it to starting to change to a more growth mindset – believing in myself a lot more and instead of sitting on the sideline of my life, taking control and changing it.
<br>
<br>
<strong><u>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</u></strong>
<br>
I will keep persevering with tasks that I find difficult and remind myself that I am learning and it will come. I won’t throw in the towel when I feel like I can’t do something. I will remind myself why I am doing this and where I want to be in my life in years to come and how persistence is the way to get there. No one is going to do this for me!

<br>
<strong><u>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</u></strong>
<br>
The knowledge of neuroplasticity and a growth mindset will influence my learning plan because I know that I CAN get through these challenges I face and that my mind can grow and change.  Even if I can’t do it now, I will get to a point where I can if I keep at it and give it my all.
