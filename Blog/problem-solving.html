    <p>I have had many instances where I have been blocked on a problem or thought I had the problem right and didn’t quite understand why my code wasn’t passing. To problem solve I would get in touch with one of my friends in my cohort and talk through the problem with them. More often than not, as I was explaining it to them, I would see my error and be able to fix it myself or if I didn’t manage to figure it out after explaining it to them, they would then do their best to explain how they understood it in simpler terms which would often lead to me having a greater understanding and being able to work through the problem. Throughout the process I felt supported and it really helped me to learn about breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks so it wasn’t such a daunting task.

        During Sprint 4 I was dreading the Javascript Kata exercises. I don’t know why exactly, I guess I knew that my JavaScript skills are very limited and that it would mean I would be struggling my way through this long challenge. When I first opened the Variables & Objects exercise I was surprised that I felt confident in my ability to write the code that was needed. I wrote what I thought the answer was and found it didn’t pass the test. Immediate disappointment. After reading the code errors I found that I had spelt a name wrong so swiftly corrected it and passed the test! I felt that I must underestimate myself and learnt that I need to trust the process and that it will all come in time.

<u>Confidence in using problem-solving techniques/processes/u>
    <br>
<u>Pseudocode –</u> 10/10 confidence in understanding what it is and how I should use it, 7/10 confidence in being able to write out exactly what I need to do as a lot of my coding seems to be trial and error and learning as I am going along.

<u>Trying something –</u> 9/10 confidence. This seems to be my most common problem-solving technique but it can sometimes lead me to over-complicate things that may have a simple answer.

<u>Rubber ducky method –</u> 10/10 confidence. I find this method really helpful and use it often.

<u>Reading error messages -</u> 6/10 confidence. I find this to be quite difficult and tend to spend more time that I would like figuring out what each message means. 

<u>Console.logging –</u> 9/10 confidence.

<u>Googling –</u> 7/10 confidence. I thought I was really good at Googling before starting at Dev Academy but in the word of coding there are so many ways you can solve a problem and I find that Googling can sometimes make me more confused! There also seem to be lots of old methods that aren’t best practice anymore and it can sometimes be difficult to know which ones these are.

<u>Asking your peers for help –</u>7/10 confidence. I do ask my peers for help but can sometimes feel like I should know the answer to a certain question and it can make me feel a bit dumb having to ask for help. Something I need to get over.

<u>Asking coaches for help –</u>6/10 confidence. It is not something that I have really done throughout Foundations, the coaches have normally reached out to me when they can see I am struggling on a particular problem. Again, I feel like I should know these things and can feel dumb when I don’t.

<u>Improving you process with reflection –</u> 6/10 confidence. I do reflect and think of ways that I can better execute something but it is so easy to just fall back into old habits and forget what it is you were planning on changing. Something I need to work on…
