    <h1> What is emotional intelligence</h1>

        </h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is to be able to accurately perceive the emotion/s (can include facial expressions and body language), to be able to understand why we/they are feeling the emotion and empathize, and to be able to manage and regulate emotions – as well as being able to communicate these successfully.

           <strong><u>How is EQ different to IQ?</u></strong> 
            <br>
            IQ is used to determine academic abilities such as one’s ability to solve problems and understand or convey compound ideas. EQ measures one’ social and emotional capability.

            <strong><u>Why is EQ important?</u></strong> 
            <br>
            EQ is important as it helps us to be better humans being by being more self and socially aware. It is a key factor in building relationships, defusing stress and conflict within ourselves and with others and helps us to be more empathetic and compassionate which in turn, makes for a kinder person.
