<h1><u>JavaScript fundamentals</u></h1>
<strong><u>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</u></strong>
<br>
If HTML, CSS and JavaScript were a car, HTML would be the frame or structure that makes up the car. CSS would be the paint used to make the car look nice and JavaScript would be the engine to make the car go. When all three are combined you have a car that is structurally sound, looks good and takes you where you want to go!

<strong><u>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</u></strong>
<br>
Control flow is the order in which a computer reads code. It is normally run in order from the first line until the last line, unless something changes the control flow eg. loops. Loops are used to repeat a chunk of code a set number of times or until a condition is met. Loops are a great way to reduce your code and not have to repeat it, therefore boosting productivity in your work and efficiency in your code. 
An example of control flow in everyday life is my morning routine:
<ul>
<li>Wake up</li>
<li>Have a shower</li>
<li>Get changed</li>
<li>Have breakfast</li>
<li>Brush teeth</li>
<li>Pack Belle’s bag</li>
<li>Get in the car</li>
<li>Drive to school</li>
</ul>
An example of something (loop) that would change my morning routine (control flow) is if I were to pop a tyre. I would then have to go through the steps (loop) of changing the tyre (multiple times if I couldn’t get it right - loop) until the tyre is fixed (the condition is met).

<strong><u>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</u></strong>
<br>
The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a map of a website. It shows you where everything on the website is located. Through the DOM we can use JavaScript to add, remove and modify existing elements on a webpage ie. If you wanted to remove an element on a webpage you could use the DOM combined with JavaScript to find it and delete it.

<strong><u>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</u></strong>
<br>
Arrays and objects are two ways of collecting data into a group. Arrays keep track of the order of the data and are useful if you want to manipulate data as a batch whilst objects are grouped properties of a single item that each have their own type. 
<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</u></strong>
<br>
Functions in JavaScript are pieces of code that perform tasks. They are helpful because once you have created a function, they can be used again and again and you don’t need to retype that piece of code. In doing so, this not only condenses the code, but saves the programmer time.
