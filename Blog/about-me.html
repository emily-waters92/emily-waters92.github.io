        <h1>An insight...</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br> 
       <p> 1.	Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. <br><br>
        An ethical decision that I have made was to adopt my dog instead of buying a ‘designer puppy’ from a breeder.
        <br> Whilst it would be nice to choose the colour, breed and gender of my dog, I consider breeders to be unethical in the sense that a lot choose to disregard the physical and emotional health of the breeding dog and that is not something that I could support.
        <br> As a compassionate, empathetic person I also consider breeders unnecessary. There are so many unwanted dogs out there that could end up being euthanised through no fault of their own, so why wouldn’t I adopt one of them instead?
        <br> In doing so, not only do I have the most loyal, loving and grateful dog ever, but I made an ethical decision and saved their life. Buying pets from breeders supports the breeder’s business and in doing so, encourages them to continue.
        <br> Little thought goes into the breeding animals’ emotional health, not to mention the physical aspect of all the pregnancies they have to endure – they are simply a means to making the breeder more money.
        <br> My adopted best friend is just that – my best friend. He really is the best dog I could have hoped for and I feel so happy that I have saved him from a life of being chained up, neglected and potentially abused.
        <br> <br>
        2.	Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
        <br> <br>
        As a Kiwi, and having grown up surrounded by Kiwi’s in this big melting pot we call Aotearoa, I find that I have garnered the typical Kiwi identity of being a friendly, relaxed and welcoming person.
        <br> I am also not one to keel-over at the slightest inconvenience (Dad’s words of “Pull your socks up and get on with it!” still ring in my ears) and have the inventive, D-I-Y Kiwi spirit.
        <br> My parents (Dad-English, Mum-Kiwi) have absolutely influenced my values and identity with majority of my values aligning with theirs such as generosity and determination, however I have found that many relationships throughout my life have also added to these values.
        <br> Having been in a long-term relationship with someone who suffered severely from mental health problems, I have found that I have learned to be more empathetic and compassionate towards people I meet – you never know what people are going through!
        <br> I have also learned through the birth of my daughter, tolerance and equanimity - which is certainly not something my mother taught me! 
        <br> <br>
        3.	Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
        <br> <br>
        
        Strengths of mine and how I think they will support me during my learning journey – 
        <br>
        <ul class="strengths">
        <li class="strengths">Leadership: I am able to encourage a group to get things done whilst maintaining good relationships within the group, which will not only be supportive to my own learning but to other class members during collaborative projects.
        <br> I am also able to create strong relationships with individuals through being a confident leader which is important for social connection and support – both things that I need to be successful in my learning journey.</li>
        
        <li class="strengths">Social intelligence: Social intelligence is something that I think is an invaluable skill to possess – not only as an employee or a student but as a friend, mentor or parent.
        <br> Being aware of the motives/feelings of others and knowing what to do to fit into different social situations is something that will benefit me greatly on my learning journey as it is something that will serve me in working productively with others.
        <br> It will also help me to form strong relationships with my peers and mentors which in turn, will benefit me OUTSIDE of my learning journey (do we ever really stop on this learning journey thing though?)</li>
        
        <li class="strengths">Humor: Humor is something that I feel is needed to be able to work in high stress environments such as software development.
        <br> When faced with an issue, learning how to be light-hearted and laugh about it is not only good for the soul, but can help me to stay relaxed and therefore come at the issue from a less stressed place, ideally one with more mental clarity.
        <br> Surely that is better for problem solving, right?!</li>
        
        <li class="strengths">Perspective: Having perspective is something that will definitely serve me in this learning journey as it is something that one needs for problem solving.
        <br> To be able to step back and look at things from a different perspective in software developing will be a great tool and also to be able to provide counsel to others within my cohort will be through the use of perspective.</li> </ul>
