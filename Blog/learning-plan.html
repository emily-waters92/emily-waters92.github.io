            <p><u>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</u>
                <br>
                I would love to become a website designer and to work my way up in a company to a leadership role. To be able to work from home would be a bonus too as my daughter has a full-on dance schedule!
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</u>
                <br>
                My strengths would be my work ethic – I will go and go until I get what I need to get done, done but that could also be a limitation as I could be prone to burnout. Another limitation is I tend to get distracted easily (hopefully this will change when my daughter goes back to school). I am a problem solver, so that is definitely a strength of mine, being a single Mum I have had to adapt and figure it out or it won’t get done as I can’t afford to pay any one to do it!
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</u>
                <br>
                Learning how to stop and meditate or turn off my brain. I think it will be really beneficial to my focus (or lack of!). I really enjoyed looking into my values, strengths and limitations too so more of that sort of thing where we do a deep dive into our psyche as I believe that this will help me to develop skills where I may be limited.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</u>
                <br>
                I will stop and take regular breaks so as not to get stressed out or burnt out. I will present the best of myself to facilitators, industry and community representatives as I myself am a representative of Dev Academy. I will change it up if I am feeling stuck or stressed – go for a walk outside, go and get a coffee, change up the scenery. I will put my best effort in everyday and give my all to this programme, my peers and my facilitators.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</u>
                <br>
                I will continue to use Toggl Track so that I can see how long I am spending on certain projects, set myself timebox goals and use the Pomodoro timer. I will reach out for help on Discord to my cohort peers when I need help with something that is taking me past my timebox goal.
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</u>
                <br>
                Patience and kindness while we are learning this new language. To be willing to help when we are stuck and maybe offer up a bit of advice, support or humour when needed!
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</u>
                <br>
                Monday-Friday morning during the school term I will have to drop my daughter off to the bus stop at 7.47am in Petone – I will then head straight into the Wellington campus. I will have to pick her up at 6pm Monday-Friday from after school care during term time too except when I arrange my parents to pick her up (they are flexible with this). I will have a point on a Saturday (yet to be confirmed) that I will have to drop her off to her dance lessons and on a Sunday morning 10-11am when she has a tennis lesson.
